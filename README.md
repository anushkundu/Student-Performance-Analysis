# Student Performance Analysis

Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze and identify key factors influencing student academic performance. This includes exploring relationships between various attributes (such as demographic, social, and educational factors) and their impact on students' grades or outcomes. Ultimately, the analysis aims to provide actionable insights for improving student performance.

# Key Tasks

1. Data Collection and Exploration

Objective: Understand the structure and content of the dataset.

Actions:

•	  Loaded the dataset and performed an initial review of its features and records.

•	Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and anomalies in the data.

2. Data Preprocessing

Objective: Prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling.

Actions:

•	Addressed missing or inconsistent values.

•	Transformed categorical variables into numerical representations.

•	Scaled numerical features for consistency.

3. Feature Selection

Objective: Identify the most significant features influencing student performance.

Actions:

•	Used statistical techniques and domain knowledge to select relevant variables.

•	Evaluated feature importance using machine learning models.

4. Model Building

Objective: Predict student performance based on selected features.

Actions:

•	Trained multiple machine learning models, including regression and classification algorithms.

•	Optimized model parameters to enhance predictive accuracy.

5. Evaluation

Objective: Assess the performance of the models.

Actions:

•	Compared models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

•	Analyzed errors to identify areas for improvement.

# Key Outcomes

Insights:

•	Highlighted the primary factors influencing student performance.

•	Provided actionable recommendations for educators and policymakers.

Models:
